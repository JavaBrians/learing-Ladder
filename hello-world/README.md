# Hello World

Welcome to Hello World on Exercism's Java Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

The classical introductory exercise.
Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"][hello-world] is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Modify the provided code so that it produces the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

Since this is your first Java exercise, we've included a detailed [Tutorial] that guides you through your solution. Check it out for tips and assistance!

### Introduction

Welcome to the first exercise on the Java track!

This document is a step-by-step guide to solving this exercise.
The instructions should work equally well on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Even if you are already familiar with Java basics, stepping through this guide may be helpful as it will help you understand the output from the tool, Gradle, that we use to compile and test our code, as well as introduce some of the patterns common to all exercises in this track.

### Exercise Structure

When you fetch a new Java exercise, you will receive:

- __one or more test files__ (always).
These live in the `src/test/java` directory and define a set of tests that our solution must satisfy before we can safely declare that it is working.
- __one or more starter files__ (initially).
If provided, these live in the `src/main/java` directory and define shells of the classes you will need in order to solve the current problem.

### Solving "Hello, World!"

You can use our online editor to solve your solution and run the tests, but if you want to solve the problem and run tests locally check these links below:

- [Installing Java]
- [Working Locally]
- [Testing locally on the java track]

### Step 1: Fix the solution

Either working locally or using the online editor, you should find the following code:

```java
String getGreeting() {
    return "Goodbye, Mars!";
}
```

The objective is to modify the provided code so it produces the text `"Hello, World!"` instead of `"Goodbye, Mars!"`.

### Step 2: Run the Tests

After making corrections and implementing your solution, run the tests again.
You can run the tests using the online editor or locally on your machine:

- To run the tests in the online editor, click the "Run Tests" button.
- To run the tests locally, check [Testing on the Java track][Testing locally on the java track] If the tests fails, that's ok! See what the error message is telling you, change your code and test again, when your tests pass, move on to the next step.
